# üíî The Ex-Terminator: AugmentCode Data Cleaner v1.1
## *"Because sometimes you need a clean break from your digital past"*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer (Unlike Your Ex's Promises)

**This tool is provided for educational and personal use only.** Always backup your data before use - we're more reliable than your ex's "I'll change" promises, but we still recommend caution!

Optional dependencies (see `requirements.txt`):
- `pyinstaller` (for creating standalone executables - independence at its finest!)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Easier Than Getting Over Your Ex)

### Option 1: Run from Source (The "I Can Do This Myself" Approach)
1. Clone or download this repository (it won't leave you hanging)
2. Install Python 3.7+ if not already installed (more reliable than your ex's promises)
3. Install optional dependencies (they actually show up when needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application (it actually runs, imagine that!):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Create Standalone Executable (The "Independence Day" Method)
1. Install PyInstaller (it won't ask for your Netflix password):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Create executable (more self-sufficient than your ex ever was):
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
   ```
3. Find the executable in the `dist` folder (it'll be exactly where it says it is - revolutionary!)

## üéØ Email Reuse Solution (The "Fresh Start" Package)

### The Problem (Like Your Ex, But Digital)
Many users want to reuse the same email address after their AugmentCode plan expires, but the system may detect and block this. It's like your ex recognizing you at the grocery store even after you changed your hair - awkward and unwanted. The enhanced cleaner solves this by:

- **Removing email traces**: Finds and removes email addresses more thoroughly than your ex removed their stuff from your apartment
- **Cleaning account data**: Removes user records like your ex should have removed themselves from your life
- **Resetting device identity**: Changes device IDs to appear as a completely new machine (witness protection program for your computer)
- **Clearing authentication**: Removes cached login data faster than your ex cleared their browser history

### The Result (Better Than Therapy)
‚úÖ **Same email can be reused** - All local traces are removed (unlike your ex's lingering presence)
‚úÖ **Device appears new** - Fresh device fingerprint generated (new phone, who dis?)
‚úÖ **Clean authentication state** - No cached login data remains (clean slate, clean conscience)
‚úÖ **Safe operation** - Complete backup system for easy restoration (unlike your relationship, this is reversible)

**See [EMAIL_CLEANING_GUIDE.md](EMAIL_CLEANING_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions (clearer than your ex's mixed signals).**

## üîß Technical Details (The Nerdy Stuff Your Ex Never Understood)

### Data Discovery Process (Better Detective Work Than Finding Your Ex's Red Flags)
The tool searches for AugmentCode data in these locations (it actually looks where it says it will):

**Windows (The Complicated One):**
- `%APPDATA%\AugmentCode` (where secrets hide)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AugmentCode` (local drama storage)
- `%PROGRAMDATA%\AugmentCode` (shared problems)
- `%PROGRAMFILES%\AugmentCode` (the official residence)

**macOS (The Pretentious One):**
- `~/Library/Application Support/AugmentCode` (fancy hiding spot)
- `/Library/Application Support/AugmentCode` (system-wide drama)
- `~/.config/AugmentCode` (configuration confusion)

**Linux (The Honest One):**
- `~/.config/AugmentCode` (straightforward, unlike your ex)
- `~/.local/share/AugmentCode` (personal space that's actually respected)
- `/opt/AugmentCode` (optional, like your ex should have been)

### Telemetry ID Modification (Digital Witness Protection Program)
- Searches configuration files (JSON, INI, XML) for ID patterns (more thorough than your ex's background checks)
- Generates new UUIDs for device and machine identifiers (new identity, new life)
- Updates Windows registry entries (Windows only) - deep cleaning where it counts
- Backs up original values before modification (safety first, unlike your relationship choices)

### Database Cleaning (Digital Therapy Session)
- Identifies SQLite database files (finds the emotional baggage)
- Searches for tables containing user/session data (digs deep into the issues)

- Provides selective cleaning options (you choose what goes, unlike your ex who took everything)
- Preserves important project files (protects what matters)

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures (More Protection Than Your Ex Ever Gave You)

### Backup System (The Safety Net Your Relationship Needed)
- **Timestamped Backups**: Each backup has a unique timestamp (better record-keeping than your ex's alibis)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Backs up files, directories, and registry data (covers all the bases)
- **Manifest Files**: JSON manifests track what was backed up (paper trail that actually exists)
- **Easy Restoration**: One-click restore functionality (undo button for life)

### Error Handling (Dealing With Problems Like an Adult)
- **Permission Checks**: Handles access denied errors gracefully (takes "no" for an answer)

## üêõ Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong, Unlike Your Ex Who Just Went)

### Common Issues (Less Drama Than Your Ex's Problems)

**"Permission Denied" Errors (The Digital Restraining Order):**
- Run as Administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/macOS) - sometimes you need the big guns
- Close AugmentCode before running the cleaner - no cheating while we're working
- Check file permissions in the AugmentCode directory - make sure we're actually invited to the party

**"No AugmentCode Data Found" (Playing Hide and Seek):**
- Verify AugmentCode is installed - it might be ghosting you like your ex
- Try manual path selection with Browse button - sometimes you have to point things out
- Check if AugmentCode uses a non-standard installation directory - it might be as unpredictable as your ex's location

**"Database Locked" Errors (The Commitment Issues):**
- Ensure AugmentCode is completely closed - no half-measures here
- Check for background AugmentCode processes - make sure it's not lurking around
- Restart the computer if necessary - the classic "turn it off and on again" (works better than relationship advice)

**Backup/Restore Issues (When Your Safety Net Has Holes):**
- Verify sufficient disk space for backups - we need room to work our magic
- Check backup directory permissions - make sure we can actually save you
- Ensure backup files haven't been moved or deleted - unlike your ex, we need these to stick around

### Getting Help (Actual Support, Imagine That!)
1. Check the activity log in the main tab for detailed error messages (clearer than your ex's communication)
2. Review the discovery report for data location issues (better detective work than finding your ex's red flags)
3. Verify all AugmentCode processes are closed before running cleanup (no multitasking during breakups)
4. Try running with administrator privileges (sometimes you need to be the boss)
