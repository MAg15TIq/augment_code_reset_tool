3. **Device ID Reset**: Changes device and machine IDs to appear as a new device
4. **Session Clearing**: Removes authentication tokens and cached login data

### Result
After running the enhanced cleaner:
- ‚úÖ **Same email can be reused** - All traces of the email are removed locally
- ‚úÖ **Device appears new** - Fresh device and machine IDs generated
- ‚úÖ **Clean authentication state** - No cached login data remains
- ‚úÖ **Safe operation** - Complete backup system for easy restoration

## üîç What Gets Cleaned

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Safety First
- **Always create backups** before running cleanup
- Test with non-critical data first
- Keep backup files until you verify everything works
- Use the restore function if issues occur

### Effectiveness
- **Local data only**: This tool cleans local data on your computer
- **Server-side data**: AugmentCode's servers may still have records
- **Best results**: Combine with device ID changes for maximum effectiveness
- **Account limits**: Server-side account limits may still apply

### Recommendations
1. **Close AugmentCode** completely before running the cleaner
2. **Run as Administrator** for full access to all files
3. **Use specific email targeting** when possible for safer operation
4. **Verify results** by checking the discovery report after cleaning

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Command Line Options
```bash
# Run with specific email target
python main.py --target-email user@example.com

# Remove all account data
python main.py --remove-all-accounts

# Custom backup location
python main.py --backup-path /path/to/backups
```

### Automation
The tool can be integrated into scripts for automated cleaning:

```python
from data_cleaner import FreeAugmentCodeCleaner

cleaner = FreeAugmentCodeCleaner()
cleaner.discover_augmentcode_data()

cleanup_options = {
    'clean_account_data': True,
    'target_email': 'user@example.com',
    'modify_telemetry_ids': True,
    'clean_database': True
}

success = cleaner.perform_cleanup(cleanup_options)
```

## üéâ Conclusion

The enhanced email cleaning functionality makes it possible to reuse the same email address with AugmentCode by:

1. **Removing all local traces** of the email address
2. **Resetting device identification** to appear as a new machine
3. **Clearing authentication state** for fresh login experience
4. **Providing safe backup/restore** for peace of mind

This comprehensive approach addresses the core issue of email reuse while maintaining the safety and reliability of the original tool.
